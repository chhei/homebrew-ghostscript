# README for Ghostscript@9.50

This brew tap provides brewing instructions for ghostscript version 9.50 which is needed to compile GMT due to a bug in gs9.52.

The syntax has been copied from the [homebrew-core ghostscript formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ghostscript.rb), only adopted for version 9.50.

As this is a shameless copy, no guarantees are taken for anything. Please feel free to provide improvements. Also note, this was done for Mac OS X only.

Ghostscript releases are taken from [Artifex's GitHub releases](https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases), the versions are released under AGPL and Ghostscript commercial licenses - see the [license versions here](https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html).
